  abstract = {We report on the design of the new clearinghouse adopted by the National Resident Matching Program, which annually fills approximately 20,000 jobs for new physicians in the United States.  Because that market exhibits many complementarities between applicants and between positions, the theory of simple matching markets does not apply directly.  However, computational experiments reveal that the theory provides a good approximation, and furthermore the set of stable matchings, and the opportunities for strategic manipulation, are surprisingly small. A new kind of  core convergence' result is presented to explain this; the fact that each applicant can interview for only a small fraction of available positions is important.  We also describe in detail engineering aspects of the design process.},

We extend the definition of serial dictatorship to settings in which some agents may be entitled to receive more than one object, and study the efficiency and uniqueness properties of the equilibrium allocations. We prove that subgame perfect equilibrium allocations of serial dictatorship games are not necessarily Pareto optimal; and generally not all Pareto optima can be implemented as subgame perfect equilibrium allocations of serial dictatorship games, except in the 2-agent separable preference case. Moreover, serial dictatorship games do not necessarily have unique subgame perfect equilibrium allocations, except in the 2-agent case, hence their outcomes are indeterminate and manipulable."

The concepts of balanced game and core are developed, and a general theorem of Scarf's is applied to prove that the market in question has a nonempty core, that is, at least one outcome that no subset of traders can improve upon. A number of examples are discussed, and the final section reviews a series of other models involving indivisible commodities, with references to the literature."
