Matching algorithms are of great interest due to the diverse use cases that exist in the real world. This thesis explores matching mechanisms for one-to-many matching scenarios with one-sided preferences by using a student-seminar-matching scenario as a motivating example. We first discuss several optimality criteria and four algorithms with different characteristics, before investigating the algorithms' performance characteristics in theoretical and experimental settings. The experiments show that reducing the problem to the assignment problem or performing a min-weight max-cardinality matching on the problem's induced bipartite graph yields the best results for most metrics and instances. Additionally, an interactive web system is presented that allows for managing and executing such matching scenarios by employing the presented algorithms.
