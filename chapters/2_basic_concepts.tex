\subsection{Graph Matching}

\subsubsection{Unweighted Graphs}

\subsubsection{Weighted Graphs}
Let $G = (V, E)$ be an arbitrary edge-weighted graph, so that 
every edge $e \in E$ has an associated weight $w(e) \in \mathbb{N}$.
The weight of a Matching M is now defined as $w(M) = \sum_{e \in M} w(e)$.
\newline
In the previous section we have already defined the maximum cardinality
matching problem. Using the definition of a Matching's weight we can now
define the maximum weight matching problem. The goal of this problem is to 
find a maximum cardinality matching that maximizes the sum of edge weights.
