\section{Implementation}

\subsection{Overview}
To allow for further experimentation with my findings, I will describe a prototype for an interactive web-system, built for computing student-seminar matchings. The requirements for this system were quite simple to keep it in scope of this thesis. The system constists of a website, which communicates with a server that manages the underlying data and computes the matchings. The requirements can be listed as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Allow for adding and deleting student and seminar data.
    \item Allow for computing a match using the previously entered data.
    \item Output the matching and it's properties.
\end{enumerate}
